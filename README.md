# Energy-Monitoring-and-Carbon-Footprint-System
Project Overview
The Energy Monitoring and Carbon Footprint System is a data-driven project designed to monitor energy usage in buildings and estimate the carbon footprint associated with that energy consumption. By utilizing sensor data, machine learning models predict energy usage and calculate the corresponding carbon emissions. The project aims to assist homeowners and businesses in understanding their energy consumption patterns and carbon impact, helping them make informed decisions to reduce both.

# Features
Energy Monitoring: Tracks energy usage based on real or simulated IoT sensor data such as temperature, humidity, and occupancy.
Carbon Footprint Estimation: Automatically calculates the carbon emissions based on the energy consumed, providing a clear picture of the environmental impact.
Prediction Models: Utilizes neural networks combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM layers, and Fully Connected Networks (FNN) for accurate energy usage prediction.
Visualizations: Graphs and charts that visualize training loss, validation loss, and comparison between actual vs predicted energy usage.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data processing and model building.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the machine learning models.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data and model performance.

# How It Works
Data Simulation: The project simulates IoT sensor data for temperature, humidity, occupancy, and energy usage.
Model Training: A neural network model is trained on the sensor data to predict energy consumption based on current conditions.
Carbon Footprint Calculation: The system calculates the carbon emissions using an assumed emission factor (kg CO2 per kWh).
Visualization: The results are displayed through various plots for insights on model performance and energy patterns.

Inputs and Outputs
Inputs: Temperature, humidity, and occupancy data (real or simulated).
Outputs: Predicted energy usage and estimated carbon footprint.

# Future Improvements
Integration with Real IoT Sensors: Replacing simulated data with real-time sensor data.
Optimization of Prediction Models: Enhancing the accuracy of energy predictions by tuning model hyperparameters.
Expanded Features: Adding functionality to suggest energy-saving strategies based on data trends.
